# JOLA MADE ME TRY TAILWIND

As per Jola's instruction, I'm learning about the awesomeness of TailwindCSS using [this tutorial on Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/@paschaldev/introducing-tailwindcss?utm_source=scotch&utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=twitter).

## SETUP

- Install dependencies with the command

```bash
yarn
```

- Initialize tailwind with the command

```bash
yarn init:tailwind
```

- Use the command below to build the css to be used by the html

```bash
yarn build:tailwind
```
